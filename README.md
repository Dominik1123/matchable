# matchable

Attribute-based object matching in Python


## Installation

From [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/matchable/):

    pip install matchable


## Usage

`matchable` is built around two objects, `match` and `Spec`:

* `match` is used to create patterns and link them to user-specified values.
* `Spec` holds a list of patterns which can be matched against arbitrary objects in order to combine their linked values.

For example:

    match(object).attr > 0

This pattern matches any object which has an attribute `attr` that compares greater than `0`.

    match(dict)['key'] == 0

This pattern matches all dicts (or subclasses thereof) with an item `'key'` which compares equal to `0`.

Such patterns can be used to create a speficiation via the `Spec` class:

    spec = Spec.from_patterns({
        match(object).attr > 0: 'foo',
        match(dict)['key'] == 0: 'bar',
    })

A spec can be used to match other objects against its patterns and to combine the corresponding values:

    >>> spec.match({'key': 0})
    'bar'
    >>> class Test:
    ...     attr = 1
    ... 
    >>> spec.match(Test())
    'foo'

If no condition matches the given object, an exception is raised:

    >>> spec.match({'key': 5})
    [...]
    matchable.exceptions.NoMatchError: No matching conditions found for object {'key': 5}

If multiple conditions match the given object, their corresponding values are combined (see the paragraph below
for what "to combine" means in different contexts):

    >>> class Test(dict):
    ...     attr = 1
    ... 
    >>> spec.match(Test(key=0))
    'bar'

Here, for strings, "to combine" means to simply select the last seen value
(for customizing this behavior, see the next section).
For dictionaries however the standard behavior is to update their content:

    >>> spec = Spec.from_patterns({
    ...     match(object).attr > 0: dict(x='foo'),
    ...     match(dict)['key'] == 0: dict(y='bar'),
    ... })
    >>> spec.match(Test(key=0))
    {'x': 'foo', 'y': 'bar'}

This is useful for combining multiple partial configurations into one.


## Registering custom combinations

The example of the previous section showed that for strings the "last seen wins" strategy
is chosen for combining two values. Another possibility would be to concatenate values.
We can implement this in the following way:

    from matchable.spec import Wrapper, WRAPPER_TYPES
    
    class Concatenate(Wrapper):
        def __or__(self, other):
            return Concatenate(self.obj + other.obj)
    
    WRAPPER_TYPES[str] = Concatenate

Basically we need to supply a custom `Wrapper` class for the corresponding type in `WRAPPER_TYPES`.
Since individual values are combined via `lhs | rhs` all this wrapper needs to do is implement the
`__or__` protocol and perform the combination logic there. Here `self.obj` accesses the wrapped object
(string in this case). It's important to note that the wrapper needs to be registered *before* creating
the spec since once the spec is created it won't change the wrapper types of its values.

So now we can create the spec and match some objects:

    spec = Spec.from_patterns({
        match(dict)['x'] > 0: 'foo',
        match(dict)['x'] > 1: 'bar',
    })

    >>> spec.match({'x': 1})
    'foo'
    >>> spec.match({'x': 2})
    'foobar'


## Patterns, Matching and the Class Hierarchy

Patterns can refer to attributes (`match(obj).x`) or items (`match(obj)['x']`) of objects of certain types
or to the type directly (either `match(tp)` or just `tp`).

During matching, if multiple patterns apply, attribute-based patterns take precedence over type-based patterns.
In fact the list of all matched patterns is sorted in a way that type-based patterns are placed on the left,
in the order of the matched object's reversed [MRO](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order),
followed by attribute-based patterns in the order of their appearance during the spec's creation.
The corresponding values are then updated from left to right where r.h.s. values update l.h.s. values (i.e. `lhs | rhs`).
For example for a list of strings, since they update as "last seen wins", the rightmost value would be the result.
For a list of sets the equivalent is `s1 | s2 | s3`, i.e. they build a union.

The `Spec.match` method also supports a `typewise` keyword-argument which can be used to alter the sorting of patterns
such that attribute-based patterns only take precedence over their associated type-based pattern but otherwise the matched
object's reverse MRO is respected. I.e. for `typewise=True` a subtype-based pattern takes predence over the attribute-based
pattern of an ancestor, while for `typewise=False` (the default) the opposite is true (since here type-based patterns are
sorted all the way to the left).

The following diagram visualizes the class hierarchy as well as the order of precedence for the different matching flavors.

## Example

Suppose a sequence of objects that should be visualized in some way. These are the objects:

    from dataclasses import dataclass

    @dataclass
    class Plant:
        height: float

    @dataclass
    class Flower(Plant):
        n_petals: int

    @dataclass
    class Tree(Plant):
        pass

    plants = [  # some random numbers
        Flower(height=4.0, n_petals=5),
        Flower(height=3.5, n_petals=7),
        Flower(height=6.8, n_petals=4),
        Tree(height=104.6),
        Flower(height=1.8, n_petals=9),
        Tree(height=187.2),
        Tree(height=121.9),
        Flower(height=2.2, n_petals=5),
    ]

Say we want to visualize these plant objects as rectangles with different styles that represent their attributes.
We can do so by creating a spec that represents the various rectangles' configurations (note that if there are
multiple matches in the spec, the dicts will be merged into one):

    config = Spec.from_patterns({
        match(Plant): dict(linestyle='-', linewidth=2, facecolor='none'),
        match(Flower): dict(edgecolor='orange'),
        match(Flower).height < 2.0: dict(hatch='/'),
        match(Flower).n_petals >= 7: dict(facecolor='#ff7f0e33'),
        match(Tree): dict(edgecolor='green'),
        match(Tree).height > 160: dict(linestyle='--'),
    })

Then we can add the Rectangle patches as follows:

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    for i, plant in enumerate(plants):
        ax.add_patch(Rectangle((i, 0), 0.5, 1, **config.match(plant)))

This gives us the following plot:
